## Landing Page
We will be basing the landing page layout on my e-portfolio: https://elijah-alonzo.vercel.app. The landing page will consist of the home section and the game mode select section. Please refer to the images in this directory for context. When clicking on the Get Started button, the page will redirect to the gamemode section. When clicking on the support the dev button it will redirect to my e-portfolio. Please reuse the layout of the home section in my portfolio for the home section of the Lucky Llama and use the certifications and training section layout for the game mode select section.
