## General Overview for Lucky Llama
Lucky LLama is a web app with the sole purpose of providing interactive ways for randomizing and making party games interactive. It has four gamemodes: Rolling Roullete which is a spinner that holds multiple text, Capricious Cards where mutiple cards are set and is flipped on its backside selecting one unflips the card, Blithe Bottle is just a spinning bottle kinda like a digital spin the bottle, and spinning slots which is a slot machine. We will be working now on the Bilthe Bottle.

## Bilthe Bottle
The layout should be exactly like the Home Page and the Rolling Roullete to have a consistent feel. The point of this game is to provide a spinning bottle for people who doesnt have a bottle to use. The main function is just that the bottle spins and points in random directions.

## Notes
I added the bottle.png in the public directory to use as the spinning bottle.
