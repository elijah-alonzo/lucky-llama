## General Overview for Lucky Llama
Lucky LLama is a web app with the sole purpose of providing interactive ways for randomizing and making party games interactive. It has four gamemodes: Rolling Roullete which is a spinner that holds multiple text, Capricious Cards where mutiple cards are set and is flipped on its backside selecting one unflips the card, Blithe Bottle is just a spinning bottle kinda like a digital spin the bottle, and spinning slots which is a slot machine. We will be working now on the Bilthe Bottle.

## Bilthe Bottle
The layout should be exactly like the Home Page and the Rolling Roullete to have a consistent feel. The point of this game is to provide a spinning bottle for people who doesnt have a bottle to use. The main function is just that the bottle spins and points in random directions.

## Notes
I added the bottle.png in the public directory to use as the spinning bottle.

## Corrections
1. Remove the directions. Game doesn need that.
2. Make the bottle a bit bigger in the desktop view.
3. Can we make the success message display the bottle and the direction it is pointing at? For exaple the image of the bottle is pointing at the east, the success messaeg will display the bottle in it pointing at the east as well.
